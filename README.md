# SVM-
This project utilizes Support Vector Machines (SVM) to predict heart disease based on patient attributes. After preprocessing, the dataset is split for training and testing. The SVM model, employing a linear kernel, achieves accurate predictions. A pairplot visualization highlights feature relationships. This tool aids in early heart disease detection, enhancing patient care.
